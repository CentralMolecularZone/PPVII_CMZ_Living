## What is a Living Review?
A living review is a literature review article that is updated with new results from the literature at regular intervals after initial publication. The original authors may serve as editors for future changes or they may pass this task on. The editorial team reviews, at regular intervals, suggestions and comments from the community as well as make their own assessment of changes to the status of the literature, and update the review article to a new version at the end of this review period. Each version of the review article can be cited independently.
